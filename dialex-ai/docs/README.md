# Dialex AI Documentation Hub

Welcome to the official technical and user documentation suite for **Dialex AI** — the sovereign cross-platform multi-agent adversarial deliberation and synthetic advisory platform developed by **Kolta Labs**.

## 🌟 Core Value Proposition & Key USPs

| Key Unique Selling Point | Technical Reality & Business Impact |
|---|---|
| 🏛️ **Hegelian Multi-Agent Deliberation** | Pits competing frontier models (**Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Ollama**) against each other to eliminate single-model hallucinations, sycophancy, and cognitive blind spots. |
| 💰 **$0 Marginal Token Cost via Local CLIs** | Connect directly to existing, already-authenticated developer CLI subscriptions (`claude`, `codex`, `antigravity`/`agy`, `ollama`). Eliminates runaway enterprise API credit card bills and expensive per-token fees. |
| 📦 **1-Click Native Desktop Downloadables** | Standalone native installers for **macOS (.dmg / .app)**, **Windows (.msi / .exe)**, **Linux (.AppImage / .deb / .rpm)**, and **Android (.apk)**. Zero terminal commands required for end-users. |
| 🔒 **100% Sovereign Zero-Cloud Vault** | Credentials encrypted at rest via Argon2id + AES-256-GCM and Android Hardware Keystore (TEE/StrongBox). Run 100% offline with local models or in isolated private on-prem networks. |
| ⚡ **Deterministic Go Turn State Machine** | Orchestrates debate rounds through a strict concurrency engine with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming, progressive cost meters, and **Instant Human Interrupts** with zero state corruption. |
| 🎯 **Actionable Generative Deliverables** | Synthesizes consensus into production-ready **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)**, **Weighted Decision Matrices**, **Pro/Con Breakdowns**, **Executive Memos (HTML)**, and **Code Diffs**. |

Explore our comprehensive guides organized by domain and objective:

### 1. Conceptual & Strategic Foundation
- [**Product Philosophy & Epistemology**](PRODUCT_PHILOSOPHY.md)  
  *The epistemological case for dialectic multi-agent councils, why single-prompt LLMs fail, Bayesian credence updating, 3-tier anti-fluff guardrails, and data sovereignty.*
- [**Executive Overview & Strategic Value**](EXECUTIVE_OVERVIEW.md)  
  *Business justification, executive summary, ROI models, enterprise risk mitigation, and synthetic advisory board economics.*
- [**Complete Feature Catalog**](02_FEATURE_LIST.md)  
  *Full inventory of capabilities, debate archetypes, domain personas, status badges, style modifiers, and target personas.*

### 2. Operational & User Manuals
- [**User Guide & Deliberation Manual**](USER_GUIDE.md)  
  *Step-by-step handbook covering project setup, council configurations, 1-on-1 Socratic interviews, live steering, artifact extraction, and mobile companion pairing.*
- [**Enterprise Use Cases & Deliberation Playbooks**](USE_CASES.md)  
  *Battle-tested, ready-to-run playbooks for Systems Architecture (Kafka vs Pulsar, Monolith vs Microservices), Cybersecurity Threat Modeling, Capital Allocation, and AI Infrastructure.*

### 3. Architecture & Technical Design
- [**Deep Architecture & Clean Call Chains**](ARCHITECTURE.md)  
  *Strict Clean Architecture layering in KMP (`domain` $\rightarrow$ `data` $\rightarrow$ `presentation`), unidirectional MVI (`Contract.kt`), Go Turn State Machine, and AES-256 Vault.*
- [**REST & SSE API Reference**](API_REFERENCE.md)  
  *Complete HTTP REST endpoints, JWT authentication schemes, real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming protocols, and curl examples.*

### 4. Setup, Deployment & Administration
- [**Server & Go Engine Setup Guide**](SERVER_SETUP.md)  
  *Standalone compilation, CLI flags, systemd/launchd background daemons, Docker Compose stacks, reverse proxies, and Tailscale mesh (`tsnet`).*
- [**Client Applications Setup (Desktop & Mobile)**](CLIENT_SETUP.md)  
  *Packaging native 1-click installers (DMG, MSI, AppImage, APK), Android biometric gate, in-memory diagnostics (`AppLogStore`), and JNI.*
- [**Developer Guide & Kolt Framework**](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)  
  *Developer workspace setup, **Kolt / KoltLibs** composite build (`compose-kmp`, `AsyncState`), writing unit tests, adding new AI providers, and synthesizer extensions.*

## Essential Setup for Developers: The Kolt Ecosystem (`Kolt`)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Dialex AI depends directly on the Kolt Ecosystem (`Kolt`) via a Gradle Composite Build (`includeBuild`).**  
> If you are building from source, clone `Kolt` into the same parent directory alongside `DialexAI`:

```bash
# 1. Create a parent workspace directory
mkdir -p ~/Workspace && cd ~/Workspace

# 2. Clone Kolt
git clone https://github.com/Kolta-Labs/Kolt.git

# 3. Clone DialexAI alongside Kolt
git clone https://github.com/Kolta-Labs/DialexAI.git

# 4. Confirm directory structure:
# ~/Workspace/
#   ├── Kolt/ (or KoltLibs/)
#   └── DialexAI/
```

See [Developer Guide: Kolt Ecosystem Setup](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#2-kolt-ecosystem-koltlibs-dependency--setup) for composite build configuration and dependency substitution details.
