# Dialex Suite

**By Kolta Labs.** Tools that make AI disagree with itself before you trust it.

Dialex Suite is three products on one deliberation engine:

| Product | Folder | What it is | Stack |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dialex AI** | [`dialex-ai/`](./dialex-ai) | Desktop and Android app where several AI models debate a decision and a moderator synthesizes the result. | Kotlin Multiplatform, Compose |
| **Artix AI** | [`artix-ai/`](./artix-ai) | Autonomous engineering platform & spec-to-patch workflow for AI-written code (CLI and desktop cockpit). | Go, Compose Desktop |
| **Socratix Engine** | [`socratix-engine/`](./socratix-engine) | The shared deliberation daemon: consensus, orchestration, mesh networking, model runners. | Go 1.27 |

Start with Dialex AI for decisions, or Artix AI for autonomous development. The engine is a dependency of both.

## Quick Start

### 1. Socratix Engine (Go Daemon)
```bash
cd socratix-engine
go test ./pkg/...
go run ./cmd/socratix
```

### 2. Dialex AI (Compose Desktop & Android)
```bash
cd dialex-ai
# Run Desktop Application
./gradlew :desktopApp:run

# Compile Android Client
./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug
```

### 3. Artix AI (CLI & Desktop Cockpit)
```bash
cd artix-ai
# Build CLI binary
go build -o bin/artix ./cli/main.go
./bin/artix help

# Run Artix Cockpit Desktop App
./gradlew :app:run
```

---

## Status & Limitations

Run the tests yourself:

```bash
(cd socratix-engine && go test ./pkg/...)
(cd artix-ai        && go test ./pkg/...)
(cd dialex-ai       && ./gradlew :shared:allTests)   # includes real-engine integration tests
```

**Feature maturity**

| Tier | Features |
|---|---|
| **Core** | Council deliberation, moderator synthesis, live steering, deliverables (ADR, decision matrix, memo) |
| **Experimental** | Knowledge graph, problem decomposition, contradiction detection, dynamic retrieval, Socratic mode, benchmarking harness, persona DNA, mobile parity, Bayesian credence |
| **Planned** | Autonomous artifact sandbox |

**Known limitations**

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Debate vs single model | A benchmark harness and a 10-case set (`Dialex-Bench-10`) exist in `socratix-engine/pkg/benchmark`. **No results are published yet.** |
| Artix `plan` and review | `plan` is template-based and the reviewer is rule-based; neither calls a model. See [artix-ai/README.md](artix-ai/README.md). `artix code` writes patches with a model only when you pass `--provider` and `--model`. |
| Artix execution isolation | macOS: commands run under `sandbox-exec` with writes limited to the workspace, temp and tool caches, and network denied by default (tested). Linux: same via `bwrap` if installed (not yet tested in CI). Windows or no tool: process-group only. Reads are not restricted, so it is **not** a defence against a hostile repository. Each result reports its `isolation` level. |
| API key storage | AES-256-GCM; the key is kept in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Linux `secret-tool`) with a `0600` key-file fallback (Windows, or `DIALEX_KEY_STORAGE=file`). |
| Third-party CLI runners | Driving vendor CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, ...) depends on each vendor's terms and may break. Direct API keys or Ollama are the stable path. |

## Contributing

We want real contributors on scoped pieces of work (docs, a runner, a platform port, benchmark cases). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Contributors are credited for what they build.

## Development & Engineering Standards

All modules adhere to the [Kolta KMP & Go Engineering Standards](https://github.com/Kolta-Labs/Kolt). Personas, agents, and tooling are governed by rules symlinked in `.standards/`.
